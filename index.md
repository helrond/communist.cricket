<h1>&ldquo;No country which has cricket as one of its national games has yet gone communist.&rdquo;</h1>
<!-- <cite>Woodrow Wyatt, British politician and journalist</cite> -->

Cricket has a long and complicated (though often symbiotic) relationship with leftist politics. Woven into political tracts as a metaphor, mentions of Communism and Socialism appear regularly in cricket sportswriting. This site compiles political sportswriting, writing on sport as politics, and the lives of those who sought (or seek) to synthesize sporting bodies with the body politic.
