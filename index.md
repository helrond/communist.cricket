# &ldquo;No country which has cricket as one of its national games has yet gone communist.&rdquo;
<cite>Woodrow Wyatt</cite>

Despite claims to the contrary, cricket has a long and complicated (though often symbiotic) relationship with leftist politics. Cricket is woven into political tracts as a metaphor and mentions of Communism and Socialism appear regularly in its sportswriting.

This site compiles political sportswriting, sport as politics, and the lives of those who sought (or seek) to synthesize sporting bodies with the body politic.
